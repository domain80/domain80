A local-first budgeting app featuring offline-sync with conflict resolution, and reactive UIs. Designed for speed and usability, perfect for one-handed use when you are on the go.

As a developer dedicated to delivering complete solutions, I chose Flutter and built this app five times to master its architecture and tools.

I use it personally, and it's a fantastic utility for everyone.
