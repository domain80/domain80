Back in the day, I had a simple vision: build the best software I could, get the algorithms right, structure the data thoughtfully, push to GitHub Pages, deploy with Vercel or Netlify, and call it done. There was a certain satisfaction in that workflow—a sense that the craft itself mattered.

Today, that approach doesn't even qualify as the bare minimum. AI this, AI that. Everyone can prompt their way to something that looks good, ships fast, and checks the boxes. The conversation has shifted entirely toward speed, toward "just building," toward not over-engineering. And somewhere in that shift, we've stopped talking about rigor. We've stopped celebrating the basic competence that once defined our field.

## When Rare Things Become Common

There's an economic principle at work here: scarcity creates value. When coding was hard, when debugging required patience, when understanding data structures took real effort—those skills had worth. People developed a sense of purpose in pursuing mastery. The calluses from that hard work meant something.

But what happens when AI compresses that journey from months to minutes? When the rare thing becomes common, what becomes valuable instead?

The standard answer is: "AI will only replace those who don't know how to use it." But let's be honest about what that means. It means you become more obsolete at typing, at coding, at debugging, at code reviews, at research, at fixes. More obsolete at the deeper understanding that comes from wrestling with a problem yourself. More obsolete at the personalized experience of building software and improving your own code. More obsolete, in some fundamental sense, at the ownership of your craft.

## The Paradox We're Living

Here's what strikes me as strange: developers enthusiastically build and celebrate AI tools that are actively taking away their profession. "It's only taking away *other* people's jobs," we tell ourselves. "I know how to use it, so I'm safe."

But are we? When we tell AI what to do and it does it, we've handed over the work. The work that made us valuable is now so common that we need to do things differently—carve out new niches, reinvent ourselves, find new skills that make us indispensable again.

The cycle is almost comedic if it weren't so concerning.

## The Atrophy Question

Here's what keeps me up at night: **How can we become good at something when the process of doing that thing constantly allows us to atrophy the skills that brought us to where we are?**

Think about a beginner today. They learn to prompt before they learn to debug. They learn to review AI-generated code before they learn to write it from scratch. They optimize prompts instead of optimizing algorithms.

Will they ever develop the intuition that comes from building a hash table by hand? The pattern recognition that emerges from refactoring the same messy codebase three times? The debugging instinct that develops only after you've spent hours tracking down a segmentation fault?

Or will we create a generation of developers who are permanently intermediate—fluent in getting AI to produce code, but unable to evaluate whether that code is actually good?

## The Convenience Trade-Off

I'm not a luddite. I use AI tools. They're convenient, often brilliant, sometimes magical. But convenience comes with collateral damage, and we're not being honest about what we're trading away.

When we get the luxury of skipping the struggle, we miss the learning that happens *in* the struggle. The junior developer who uses Copilot to fix a memory leak without understanding pointers hasn't learned about memory management—they've learned prompt engineering. Those are not the same skill.

The "just build" mentality assumes that shipping is the only thing that matters. But what if the process of building—slowly, painfully, manually—is where the actual skill development happens? What if we're optimizing for the wrong metric?

## What Comes Next

These might just be thoughts. Anxieties from someone who learned to code in a different era, resisting inevitable change. Every generation has faced this: compilers replaced assembly, frameworks replaced manual DOM manipulation, ORMs replaced raw SQL. Mastery has always adapted.

But maybe this time is different. Maybe we're not just changing tools—we're changing the fundamental relationship between struggle and skill. Maybe we're about to find out whether mastery can develop without friction, or whether AI-assisted development creates a ceiling we don't yet recognize.

One thing is certain: we'll all find out soon enough. The question is whether we'll be ready for the answer, or whether we'll have atrophied too much to recognize what we've lost.

*What do you think? Are we building a generation of developers who know how to use AI but not how to build software? Or is this just the natural evolution of our craft? I'm genuinely curious where you stand on this.*
