## Rule 1: Know Yourself

Understandably, I was in an existential slump.

An old friend of mine suggested I get back into drawing. For as long as I can remember I have doodled all over anything I could. Before getting into poetry, I wanted to be an animator or a cartoonist.

The "funnies" were my favorite section of the newspaper. I read them daily, especially on Sunday. I often doodled characters and comics when I should have been paying attention in class.

```python
from collections import Counter

arr = [12, 3, 4, 15]
c = Counter(arr)
sum = 0

for key, value in c.items():
    sum += key + value

print("Sum of array is", sum)
```

## Where do you want to go

Eddy and Cy — #10 Fast by Barnabas Smith (author)

Over the last few years, I've had a series of unfortunate events that created some big changes in my life. My wife came out, we divorced, and I was laid off — those are just the highlights.

Understandably, I was in an existential slump.

An old friend of mine suggested I get back into drawing. For as long as I can remember I have doodled all over anything I could. Before getting into poetry, I wanted to be an animator or a cartoonist.

The "funnies" were my favorite section of the newspaper. I read them daily, especially on Sunday. I often doodled characters and comics when I should have been paying attention in class.

## Why do you want to go there

In high school, I began to write poetry. My poems were often accompanied by doodles. My interest and skill in art led me to a career in graphic design and marketing. As the years went on, my passion for fun faded away.

Now that I was in a moment of crisis, my friend's words called me back to the pencil and paper I had left behind.

Years before the divorce, I had signed up for an art school online, the School of Visual Storytelling. I had started classes but life caught up to me. I decided to go back to it to help jump-start my journey back to myself.
